# About me

## üéØ Mission

<br />
What thrills me? Just imagine building 1000 projects... More than 1000 projects!
Thousands upon thousands of commits and contributions! Robust, scalable, extensible, maintainable, beneficial tools and systems for everyone! Undeniable mastery of the science, art and craft of software design and development!

## üë§ Identity

<br />
Mostly an autodidact, curious, methodical and obsessed with mastery. Focused on crafting software that promotes maximum benefit. Particularly enthusiastic about open-source software, data-driven systems, distributed networks and information security.

<br />
<br />
In order to achieve my goal of becoming one of the greatest software engineers that have ever lived, I am on a long journey to build over 1000 projects! It is part of my core faith that software is crucial to solve the worst problems that plague the world (think hunger, war, organized crime). No effort is too great when working towards that outcome. But there's still much to do.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Engineering approach

<br />
My approach centers around secure coding, system architecture and software quality. Conventions, standards and best practices are essential, and must be considered when devising workflows. However, a certain degree of freedom is necessary to prevent excess rigidity.

<br />
<br />

Designing with built-in security, using the right tool for the job and following the appropriate methodologies are some of the considerations I always have in mind. I work towards mastering not only coding, but the full SDLC and all of its stages.

## üé® Interests / hobbies

<br />
When not designing and crafting software, I'm walking, reading, having conversations or working out. Other than programming, I read articles and books about psychology, typology, history, economics, finance and philosophy. Oh, and my insatiable curiosity makes me prone to fall into rabbit holes, I really need to be more focused...
