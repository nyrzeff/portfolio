# About me

## 👤 Who am I?

<br />
I'm a curious and methodical individual who likes to tinker with software. What I seek is a deep and broad understanding of the various aspects of development. I am particularly enthusiastic about open-source software, game design and development, data-driven systems, distributed networks and information security.

## 🎯 Goal

<br />
My main goal in software development is to achieve such a degree of mastery that I can build anything I want, to have full freedom to create and craft whatever I wish, from simple scripts and helper tools to games and full systems.

## ⚙️ Approach

<br />
My approach centers around secure coding, system architecture and software quality. Conventions, standards and best practices are essential, and must be considered when devising workflows. However, a certain degree of freedom is necessary to prevent excess rigidity.

<br />
<br />

Designing with built-in security, using the right tool for the job and following the appropriate methodologies are some of the considerations I always have in mind. For me, mastering only the coding aspect is not enough, I want to understand everything, the complete picture, the whole SDLC.

## 🎨 Interests / hobbies

<br />
When not designing and crafting software, I'm walking, reading, having conversations or working out. Other than programming, I read articles and books about psychology, typology, history, economics, finance and philosophy. Oh, and my endless curiosity makes me prone to fall into rabbit holes, I really need to be more focused...
