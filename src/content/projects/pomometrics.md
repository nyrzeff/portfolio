I wanted to visualize my Pomodoro sessions so I built Pomometrics, a simple, static, customizable Pomodoro breakdown visualization tool using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Chart.js.

<br />
I learned and followed best practices such as Conventional Commits, mobile-first design, responsive design, high test coverage (WIP) and refactoring. I also created the second breakdown algorithm from scratch.

<br />
<br />
Stack and tooling: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js, Vim/Neovim, ESLint, Prettier, pnpm, vite, mocha.
