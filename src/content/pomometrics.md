# Content
This is the Pomometrics project content.

## Description
I wanted to visualize my Pomodoro sessions so I built **Pomometrics**, a simple, static, customizable Pomodoro breakdown visualization tool using basic HTML/CSS/JS and Chart.js.

I learned and followed best practices such as Conventional Commits (which I mostly adhere to), mobile-first design approach, responsive design (WIP), high test coverage (WIP) and refactoring. I also created the second breakdown algorithm *from scratch*. More features soon (probably).

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js, Vim, Vimspector (Chrome and Firefox adapters), ESLint, Prettier, pnpm, vite, mocha.
